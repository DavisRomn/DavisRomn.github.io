                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Alberta has been an a rich geographic location for the discovery and analysis of the animals that dominated the land in prehistoric times, dinosaurs. Areas such as, Dinosaur Provincial Park,
                        a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and areas around Drumheller, the location of the Royal Tyrell Museum, preserve and house extraordinarily diverse groups of high-quality fossils near
                        the surface allowing for an increased ability to find and research specimens. These areas, and others within Alberta, some of which are shown in the table on the right, have allowed us to get a glimpse of the past and disover
                        and learn more about the magnificent creatures that once walked the earth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Alberta is renowned for its well-preserved fossils and study of these prehistoric animals, sometimes through mass dinosaur graves, known as bonebeds. Bonebeds, more specifically,
                        are notable accumulations of modern or fossil bones and teeth from more than one individual that occur in a single geologic stratum.
                        Bonebeds are often prized by paleonotologists and geologists because of the unique opportunities they present for study.
                        Dinosaur bonebeds in Alberta are uniquely famous because of their footbal-field sizes, the thousands of fossils they contains, and the unique paleobiological
                        information they yield.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Most of the specimens found within Alberta from the major bonebed sites date to the late cretacious period, approximately 76.5-74.8 million years ago. 
                        This page will describe just a few of the bonebeds that have allowed us to learn so much about a wide variety of dinosaurs.
