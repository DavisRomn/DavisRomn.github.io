                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Alberta has been an a rich geographic location for the discovery and analysis of the animals that dominated the land in prehistoric times, dinosaurs. Areas such as, Dinosaur Provincial Park,
                        a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and areas around Drumheller, the location of the Royal Tyrell Museum, preserve and house extraordinarily diverse groups of high-quality fossils near
                        the surface allowing for an increased ability to find and research specimens. These areas, and others within Alberta, some of which are shown in the table on the right, have allowed us to get a glimpse of the past and disover
                        and learn more about the magnificent creatures that once walked the earth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Alberta is renowned for its well-preserved fossils and study of these prehistoric animals, sometimes through mass dinosaur graves, known as bonebeds. Bonebeds, more specifically,
                        are notable accumulations of modern or fossil bones and teeth from more than one individual that occur in a single geologic stratum.
                        Bonebeds are often prized by paleonotologists and geologists because of the unique opportunities they present for study.
                        Dinosaur bonebeds in Alberta are uniquely famous because of their footbal-field sizes, the thousands of fossils they contains, and the unique paleobiological
                        information they yield.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Most of the specimens found within Alberta from the major bonebed sites date to the late cretacious period, approximately 76.5-74.8 million years ago. 
                        This page will describe just a few of the bonebeds that have allowed us to learn so much about a wide variety of dinosaurs.

                    <h3>Dinosaur Provincial Park</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Dinosaur Provincial Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located about two-and-a-half hours east of Calgary, Alberta. The parks is world renowned for being one of the richest dinosaur fossil
                        locales in the world. A total of 58 dinosaur species have been discovered at the park and more than 500 specimens have been removed and are exhibited in museums across the globe.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The sediments exposed in the badlands at Dinosaur Provincial Park were laid down over a period of approximately 1.5 million years during the late cretacious period. The sediments were deposited in
                        floodplain and coatal plain environments by river systems that flowed towards the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America in half.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Dinosaur Provincial Park preserves an extraordinarily diverse range of fossils, from freshwater vertebrates, to plant fossils, and to the well known and studied large animals. Some such large dinosaurs that
                        can be found within the Park are Ceratpsidfs, Hadrosaurids, Ankylosaurids, Tyrannosaurids, Dromaeosaurids, and many more. In addition to these larger fossils and plant impressions, Dinosaur Provincial Park also 
                        contains a wide variety of microfossils, fossils that can only be seen and identified with a microscope, which have further studied and discoveries of animals that are much smaller than normally found.

                    <h3>Dry Island Buffalo Jump</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Dry Island Buffalo Jump provincial park is the site of an ancient buffalo jump, where Cree native people drove bison over the cliffs in large numbers to provide for their tribes.
                        The hills also contain unique flora and fauna that are not found this far east of Alberta's Rocky Mountains in as large numbers as at Dry Island.
                        In relation to paleontology and dinosaur, the park contains the most important Albertosaurus bone bed in the world, which was originally discovered by Barnum Brown in 1910 and rediscovered by Dr. Phil Currie in 1997.
                        The bone bed excavation was halted at the end of August, 2005.
                        Under university auspices, excavation at the bone bed has continued in the summers of 2006, 2007 and 2008.
