                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Alberta has been an a rich geographic location for the discovery and analysis of carnivorous dinosaurs. Areas such as, Dinosaur Provincial Park,
                        a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and areas around Drumheller, the location of the Royal Tyrell Museum, preserve and house extraordinarily diverse groups of high-quality fossils near
                        the surface allowing for an increased ability to find and research specimens. These areas, and others within Alberta, contain specimens from many species of carnivorous dinosaurs including (but not limited to):
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Tyrannosaurus Rex

                            <li>
                                Gorgosaurus
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Daspletosaurus
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Albertosaurus
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Most of these specimens were laid down during the late cretacious period, approximately 76.5-74.8 million years ago. Carnivorous dinosaurs, and more specifically therapod dinosaurs (as listed above), are a general group of saurischian dinosaurs that were ancestrally carnivorous and for which birds evolved from. This page will describe these
                            incredible therapods, who are only some of the wide diversity of carnivorous dinosaurs that were present in Alberta.

                    <h3>Gorgosaurus</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Like most known tyrannosaurids, Gorgosaurus was a bipedal predator weighing more than two metric tons as an adult; dozens of large, sharp teeth lined its jaws, while its two-fingered forelimbs were comparatively small. 
                        Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus are extremely similar, distinguished mainly by subtle differences in the teeth and skull bones.
                        Gorgosaurus has only been found in Alberta, and it heavily showcased at the Royal Tyrell Museum in Alberta.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Adults reached 8 to 9 m (26 to 30 ft) from snout to tail. Paleontologists have estimated full-grown adults to weigh about 2.5 tonnes. 
                        The largest known skull measure almost a metre long, just slightly smaller than that of Daspletosaurus. 
                        As in other tyrannosaurids, the skull was large compared to its body size, although chambers within the skull bones and large openings (fenestrae) between bones reduced its weight, allowing for the gorgosaurus to hold itself up.
                        Gorgosaurus lived in a lush floodplain environment along the edge of an inland sea. It was an apex predator, preying upon abundant ceratopsids and hadrosaurs.

                        Gorgosaurus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from dozens of specimens.

                    <h3>Daspletosaurus</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Like most tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus was a multi-tonne bipedal predator equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. 
                        Living in the same time-period as the gorgosaurus, it is one of only a few examples of two tyrannosaurids co-existing.
                        It is believe that Daspletosaurus took advantage of its larger size and build to prey on more defensive and larger prey, such as ceratopsids, whereas the Gorgosaurus' likely fed on faster and more agile prey, such as hadrosaurids.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Adults could reach a length of 8â€“9 meters from snout to tail. Mass estimates have centered on approximately 2.5 tons. They also sported a massive skull, over a metre long, with the bone being heavily constructed and some even fused for extra strength.
                        Daspletosaurus shared the same body form as other tyrannosaurids.

                    <h3>Albertosaurus</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal predator with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth.
                        Albertosaurus was also likely at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem, being one of the largest predators at the time.
                        While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and possibly weighing less than 2 metric tons.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Albertosaurus was apparently restricted in range to Alberta, after which the species was named. Some scientists disagree on its content and believe it could be a species of Gorgosaurus instead.
                        Most famously, the Dry Island bonebed, located in Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park, with a total of over 1200 Albertosaurus bones being found within the site.
                        Adult Albertosaurus aged 14 years are most of the individuals who have been discovered, due to the preservation bias favoring larger bones and fossils.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Albertosaurus' were believed to be pack hunters, and behaved with pack behavious similiar to modern day wolves and large cats. This behaviour is believed due to the presence of so many individuals at the Dry Island bonebed.

                    <h3>Black Beauty</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Black Beauty, also referred to as RTMP 81.6.1, is a well-preserved fossil of a Tyrannosaurus rex. The specimin was discovered in 1980 along a riverbank in Crowsnest Pass, Alberta.
                        The nickname, 'Black Beauty', stems from the apparent shiny dark color of the fossil bones, which occured during fossilization by the presence of specific minerals in the surrounding rock.
                        The specimen has been used to study comparitive morphology and even the study of parasitic infections due to lesions found on the cranial bones of Black Beauty.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Black Beauty is the 14th-most complete-known skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex, feautring 85 original bones (28%). It is also claimed to be the smallest
                        adult T.rex specimen known.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph bottom-text">
                        The specimen is housed in the Royal Tyrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta, Canada. Casts are also on display in museums around the world. In addition to Black Beauty, A more recent and much larger specimen
                        of Tyrannosaurus Rex is currently being worked on in the University of Alberta, with the nickname of 'Scotty'
