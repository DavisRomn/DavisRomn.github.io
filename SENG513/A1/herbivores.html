                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Alberta has been an a rich geographic location for the discovery and analysis of herbivorous dinosaurs. Areas such as, Dinosaur Provincial Park,
                        a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and areas around Drumheller, the location of the Royal Tyrell Museum, preserve and house extraordinarily diverse groups of high-quality fossils near
                        the surface allowing for an increased ability to find and research specimens. These areas, and others within Alberta, contain specimens from many groups of herbivorous dinosaurs including (but not limited to):
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Ankylosaurs
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Hadrosaurs
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ceratopsids
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Most of these specimens were laid down during the late cretacious period, approximately 76.5-74.8 million years ago. Herbivorous dinosaurs in Alberta are extremely diverse, coming in all shapes and sizes. Additionally,
                            Alberta has been home to many world-renowned specimens, greatly furthering paleontological research and study.
                            This page will describe these incredible groups of herbivores, who are only some of the wide diversity of herbivorous dinosaurs that were present in Alberta.

                    <h3>Borealopelta, the Northern Shield</h3>
                    <p>
                        Borealopelta is a genus of nodosaurid ankylosaur from the Lower Cretacious of Alberta. Specifically, it contains a single species, B. markmitchelli, named and discovered in 2017.
                        It was discovered at an oil sands mine in Fort McMurray, Alberta. The specimen is remarkable for being among the best preserved dinosaur fossils ever found. It preserved not only
                        the armor in their life positions, but also remains of the keratin sheaths, overlying skin, and stomach contents. Melanosemes were also found, which indicated that the animal had a reddish skin tone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The suncor Borealopelta is remarkable for its three-dimensional preservation of the large dinosaur, complete with soft tissue. The specimen appears to have sunk upside-down onto the sea floor shortly after its death,
                        causing the top half of the body to be quickly buried with minimal distortion. The result is a specimen that preserves the animal almost as it would have looekd in life, without flattening or shriveling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The specimen also preserved numerous closely spaced rows of small armor plates, also known as osteoderms, lining the top and sides of its broad body. From the shoulder protruded
                        a pair of long spines, similarly shaped to that of the horns of a bull. Further study of the pigments present in remnants of skin and scales suggest that the reddish-brown coloration life had additional countershaded pattern
                        that was used for camouflage.

                    <h3>Hadrosaurs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Like most tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus was a multi-tonne bipedal predator equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. 
                        Living in the same time-period as the gorgosaurus, it is one of only a few examples of two tyrannosaurids co-existing.
                        It is believe that Daspletosaurus took advantage of its larger size and build to prey on more defensive and larger prey, such as ceratopsids, whereas the Gorgosaurus' likely fed on faster and more agile prey, such as hadrosaurids.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adults could reach a length of 8â€“9 meters from snout to tail. Mass estimates have centered on approximately 2.5 tons. They also sported a massive skull, over a metre long, with the bone being heavily constructed and some even fused for extra strength.
                        Daspletosaurus shared the same body form as other tyrannosaurids.

                    <h3>Ceratopsids</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal predator with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth.
                        Albertosaurus was also likely at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem, being one of the largest predators at the time.
                        While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and possibly weighing less than 2 metric tons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Albertosaurus was apparently restricted in range to Alberta, after which the species was named. Some scientists disagree on its content and believe it could be a species of Gorgosaurus instead.
                        Most famously, the Dry Island bonebed, located in Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park, with a total of over 1200 Albertosaurus bones being found within the site.
                        Adult Albertosaurus aged 14 years are most of the individuals who have been discovered, due to the preservation bias favoring larger bones and fossils.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Albertosaurus' were believed to be pack hunters, and behaved with pack behavious similiar to modern day wolves and large cats. This behaviour is believed due to the presence of so many individuals at the Dry Island bonebed.
