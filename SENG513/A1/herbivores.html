                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Alberta has been an a rich geographic location for the discovery and analysis of herbivorous dinosaurs. Areas such as, Dinosaur Provincial Park,
                        a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and areas around Drumheller, the location of the Royal Tyrell Museum, preserve and house extraordinarily diverse groups of high-quality fossils near
                        the surface allowing for an increased ability to find and research specimens. These areas, and others within Alberta, contain specimens from many groups of herbivorous dinosaurs including (but not limited to):
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Ankylosaurs
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Hadrosaurs
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Ceratopsids
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Most of these specimens were laid down during the late cretacious period, approximately 76.5-74.8 million years ago. Herbivorous dinosaurs in Alberta are extremely diverse, coming in all shapes and sizes. Additionally,
                            Alberta has been home to many world-renowned specimens, greatly furthering paleontological research and study.
                            This page will describe these incredible groups of herbivores, who are only some of the wide diversity of herbivorous dinosaurs that were present in Alberta.

                    <h3>Borealopelta, the Northern Shield</h3>
                    <p>
                        Borealopelta is a genus of nodosaurid ankylosaur from the Lower Cretacious of Alberta. Specifically, it contains a single species, B. markmitchelli, named and discovered in 2017.
                        It was discovered at an oil sands mine in Fort McMurray, Alberta. The specimen is remarkable for being among the best preserved dinosaur fossils ever found. It preserved not only
                        the armor in their life positions, but also remains of the keratin sheaths, overlying skin, and stomach contents. Melanosemes were also found, which indicated that the animal had a reddish skin tone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The suncor Borealopelta is remarkable for its three-dimensional preservation of the large dinosaur, complete with soft tissue. The specimen appears to have sunk upside-down onto the sea floor shortly after its death,
                        causing the top half of the body to be quickly buried with minimal distortion. The result is a specimen that preserves the animal almost as it would have looekd in life, without flattening or shriveling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The specimen also preserved numerous closely spaced rows of small armor plates, also known as osteoderms, lining the top and sides of its broad body. From the shoulder protruded
                        a pair of long spines, similarly shaped to that of the horns of a bull. Further study of the pigments present in remnants of skin and scales suggest that the reddish-brown coloration life had additional countershaded pattern
                        that was used for camouflage.

                    <h3>Hadrosaurs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs, are a member of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. Known as the duck-billed dinosaurs for the flat duck-bill-like appearance of the bones of their snouts,
                        these dinosaurs were large herbivorous dinosaurs commonly found during the Late Cretacious Period. Hadrosaurids, akin to their ornithischian relatives, had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which were positioned backwards
                        towards the pelvis. Hardosaurs were also split into two distinct groups, lambeosaurines, which had a hollow cranial crest or tube, and saurolophines, which lacked said crest or tube.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hadrosaurs likely grazed on horsetails and vegetation close to the ground, rather than browsing higher-growing leaves and twigs due to their apparent chewing methods but depending on the size of the 
                        hadrosaur, could sometimes be found with branches or twigs within the stomach. Hadrosaurs were also egg laying anmals, and were believed to have protected their young. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Juvenile hadrosaurs are anotomically and proportionally similar to those of adults, but some evidence suggests that yound hadrosaurs walked on their hind two leg, whereas adults would have walked on all four.

                    <h3>Ceratopsids</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ceratopsids are a group of herbiorous, beaked dinosaurs, most commonly found during the Cretacious Period. Earliest members of the ceratopsian group were small bipedal animals, but eventually
                        evolved into much larger members, such as Centrosaurus or Triceratops, who were very large quadrapreds with elaborate facial horns and frills. Ceratopsians ranged from one meter and 23kg, to over nine meters and 9000kg.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bottom-text">
                        Ceratopsians are easily recognized by the features of their skulls. In addition to their magnificent frills and horns, they also had a rostral bone on their upper jaw, which was unique to ceratopsians.
                        This small bone helped greatly in classifying and identifying specimens. Many different species and specimens of Ceratopsids have been discovered all across the world,
                         with seven distinct species being present within Dinosaur Provincial Park alone.
